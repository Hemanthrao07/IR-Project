# IR-Project

In this project we are tokenizing n number of html files and generating n+1 output files which have the tokenized texts corresponding to each input file and a file which contains the frequency of the tokenized text. Later each token is given a term weight using TF and IDF. Basic TF*IDF is used and BM25 is also used for the same.

In order to run the above project . 

1) Clone the code.
2) run the test.py using Python test.py .
3) Change the input,output and stopwords directory paths in the code.

A sample of the output files are provided in the outputfiles.zip in the repository corresponding to the input files inputfiles.zip .

This code runs in 90 secs .
